                    Take a slow breath and imagine your thoughts settling like dust after a gentle rain. The world doesn’t need you to rush right now; it’s okay to pause and let clarity return in its own quiet way. Somewhere between effort and rest, your mind remembers how to feel light again—how simple it is to notice small things, like warmth in the air or a calm rhythm in your heartbeat. In this moment, nothing is missing, nothing is late, and nothing needs fixing. Just be here, let the noise fade, and allow a soft sense of balance to wash over you.
